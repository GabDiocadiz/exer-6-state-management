## Application Description
- This Flutter application is a simple shopping cart management system. Users can browse through a catalog of items, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. Upon checkout, users can view the item details, total cost to pay, and complete the payment process.
## Things I did in the code
- Implemented a catalog screen (MyCatalog) where users can view a list of items and add them to the shopping cart.
- Implemented a shopping cart screen (MyCart) where users can view the items in their cart, remove items, and proceed to checkout.
- Implemented a checkout screen (Checkout) where users can view item details, total cost to pay, and complete the payment process.
- Used Provider package for state management to manage the shopping cart data.
- Handled scenarios such as displaying a message when the cart is empty.
## Challenges when developing the application
- Adjusting the layout to display item details and total cost in the checkout screen, ensuring proper alignment and spacing.
- Handling navigation between screens and passing data efficiently using Flutter's Navigator.
- Managing state updates and ensuring proper synchronization between different parts of the application using Provider package.
- Ensuring a consistent user experience and interface design across different screens and devices.
